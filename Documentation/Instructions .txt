Instructions :

1)Extract the .rar file in your desired location.

2)Download and install python if needed (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

3)Download and install MySQL and MySQL workbench if needed (version 8.0+) (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)

4)Open a CMD terminal or a powershell in the location you have extracted the .rar 
For example (C:\Users\UserName\Desktop\Weather forecast\

5)Install the necessary dependencies:
pip install flask mysql-connector-python --user

6)Setup mysql workbench

Run the sql script inside the folder 'Documentation' to initialize the database and the table.

**In order to run the python files you need again a terminal in the location (..\..\Weather forecast)**

7)First run fetch_data.py to fetch the data from the weather api  : Type in the terminal python fetch_data.py.

**IMPORTANT** 

-In the files fetch_data.py and app.py inside the code there is a part of code where the configuration of the database takes place, for example :

    db_config = {
        'user': 'root',  
        'password': 'test1', 
        'database': 'weatherAPI'  
    }

Those are my personal credentials for MySQL workbench, the database part is the same since you run my SQL script.
Please change the 'user' and 'password' to the ones you are using for your MySQL workbench.

-In fetch_data.py, inside the function fetch_weather_data(api_url), you can see my credentials for https://www.meteomatics.com/en/weather-api/.
We need those credentials to execute requests from the api. I recieved my credentials for free trial from the site. Feel free to use them!

8)Last, in order to run the app, type in the terminal :
python -m flask run

9)Open a web browser and paste : http://127.0.0.1:5000/

10)Enjoy!!! :)
